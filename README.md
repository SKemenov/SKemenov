## ✨ About me

I like creating apps for myself, for you, for everybody. Apps help us every day, they make our lives brighter, more interesting, more exciting!

Let's ~~get fun~~ write code together! 😄



## 📡 Projects

🔭 I'm pleased to announce the release of my long-awaited pet project - 
[Minimal Countdown Screensaver for macOS](https://github.com/SKemenov/MinimalCountdown)!

After my favorite Countdown screensaver stopped working correctly and the developer abandoned his app, I decided to create my own macOS screensaver entirely in Swift. I hope you enjoy my version! 😉

👀 I'm interested in Swift and SwiftUI. Additionally, I intend to explore more frameworks and, of course, implement them into my projects.
