# 👋 Hello everyone, It's Sergey


### ✨ About me

I'm a passionate iOS developer from Moscow.

I like creating apps for myself, for you, for everybody. Apps help us every day, they make our lives brighter, more interesting, more exciting!

Let's ~~get fun~~ write code together!

📫 How to reach me (telegram: skemenov)

#

👀 I’m interested in Swift, SwiftUI.
  
🌱 I completed an iOS developer course from Yandex.Practicum and made four iOS apps - NFT-marketplace, Tracker, ImageFeed and MovieQuiz.

💞️ I’m trying to make my own macOS screensaver using Swift, because my favorite Countdown screensaver stopped working properly and the developer abandoned his app. I hope to make a working version 😏
